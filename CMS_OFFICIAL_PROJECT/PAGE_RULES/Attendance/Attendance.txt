Attendance Page Rules

1. The `Attendance.jsx` page loads batches and records from the attendance bridge endpoints; do not recalculate totals locally.
2. Ensure role-sensitive filtering so supervisors only see their assigned batches; any check-in writes send batch/member IDs and rely on backend validation.
3. Use backend timestamps/status values instead of heuristics to avoid conflicts with CRM-managed CRM data.
