PAGE_RULES Directory

Each subfolder represents a feature or domain from the frontend (Projects, CRM, Sales, etc). Inside, keep `.txt` files named after the individual pages or workflow you want to document.

When updating a page or backend behavior, add or edit the matching file so contributors can quickly understand the UX and API contracts for that surface. If a folder currently has only an `overview.txt`, use it to capture the major rules for all pages within that feature until more granular documentation is needed.
