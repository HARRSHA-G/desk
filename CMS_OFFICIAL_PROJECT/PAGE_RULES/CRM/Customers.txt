Customers Page Rules

1. `Customers.jsx` shows CRM customer records and relies on the CRM API for contact, budget, and interest data; never duplicate this data outside the API.
2. When linking customers to projects, respect the CRM flag that binds multi-flat/multi-plot projects to CRM ownership—do not assign single customer IDs locally.
3. Searches/filters should hit the CRM endpoint rather than filtering cached arrays to stay current with CRM updates.
