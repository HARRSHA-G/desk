Channel Partners Page Rules

1. `ChannelPartners.jsx` lists CRM channel partners; it relies on the CRM API that returns partner names, contacts, and health metrics. Do not regenerate these metrics client-side.
2. Any adds/edits should post via the authenticated CRM endpoint and expect backend validation of email/phone fields.
3. Keep role-based filtering when showing partners tied to particular projects—reflect backend flags rather than local heuristics.
