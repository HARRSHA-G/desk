CRM Overview Page Rules

1. `CRMOverview.jsx` aggregates CRM metrics (leads, pipeline); all numbers must come from CRM bridge endpoints.
2. Do not expose controls that conflict with Projects’ CRM-managed rules—multi-unit projects remain assigned in CRM, not the UI.
3. Filters should re-fetch data via the CRM API and honor backend-provided status flags.
