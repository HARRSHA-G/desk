Vendors Page Rules

1. `Vendors.jsx` uses directory bridge endpoints for listing/adding vendors; include company name, contact phone, and vendor code in every payload.
2. Treat vendor entries as immutable once created until the backend confirms changes—refresh the list from `/directory/vendors` to stay up to date.
3. If vendors tie into expenses or procurement, keep the backend IDs/codes as the single source of truth, avoiding manual text duplication.
