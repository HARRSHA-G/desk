Directory Page Rules

1. `Directory.jsx` manages contacts (customers, supervisors, vendors) via dedicated directory APIs; follow the backend’s required fields (name, phone, code).
2. Avoid caching contact lists for too long—refresh from the server when reopening the page to keep CRM in sync.
3. Respect CRM-managed flags: supervisors/customers tied to multi-unit projects should not be edited here unless the backend explicitly permits it.
