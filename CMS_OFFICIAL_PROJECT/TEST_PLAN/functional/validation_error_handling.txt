================================
VALIDATION & ERROR HANDLING
================================

Scope
-----
- Required fields, max lengths, formats, and business rules across forms/APIs (e.g., positive scores, valid categories).

Tooling
-------
- pytest-django for server-side; Playwright/Cypress for UI validation messages.

Negative cases
--------------
- Missing/invalid payloads, oversized inputs, duplicates, and forbidden transitions.

Error responses
---------------
- Assert HTTP 4xx codes, structured error bodies, and human-readable messages in UI.

Edge scenarios
--------------
- Deep-link to invalid IDs, concurrent edits, and partial saves; ensure rollback and clear feedback.

Automation
----------
- Include negative tests in CI; avoid over-stubbing so real validation paths execute.
