===============================
API INTEGRATION
===============================

What to test
------------
- Django views/DRF endpoint request/response contracts.
- Auth and permission paths across roles.
- Pagination, filtering, and sorting behaviors.
- File uploads and related validation.
- Database side effects created by requests.

Recommended tools
-----------------
- pytest-django with DRF APIClient plus httpx/requests for black-box checks.
- schemathesis for schema-based fuzzing.
- sqlite for fast runs; Postgres for parity when available.

Automation approach
-------------------
- Run tagged API tests in CI.
- Seed fixtures for users/roles and sample projects/payments/expenses/attendance.
- Record snapshots for common responses.

Critical edge cases
-------------------
- Expired or invalid tokens.
- Role-based access (builder/supervisor/customer/channel partner).
- Large payloads and malformed JSON.
- Idempotent retries and rate-limits.
- Deep links with query params and online/offline retries.
