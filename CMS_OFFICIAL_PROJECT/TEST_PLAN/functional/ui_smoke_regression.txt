==============================
UI SMOKE / REGRESSION
==============================

Scope
-----
- Critical user paths (login/logout, FailureMode CRUD, Category management, Fishbone creation/edit, navigation links).

Tooling
-------
- Playwright or Cypress for E2E; pytest-selenium as an alternative; run headless in CI.

Checks
------
- Page loads without console errors; forms submit with valid data; validation messages on bad input; lists/tables refresh after actions.

Responsiveness
--------------
- Validate layout at key breakpoints (mobile/tablet/desktop), dark/light themes, and high-DPI screens.

Navigation
----------
- Direct URL/deep-link loads work, back/forward keeps state, and guarded routes redirect correctly.

Loading states
--------------
- Skeletons/spinners show during fetches and clear when data appears; no stuck loaders.

Online/offline
--------------
- Simulate offline in devtools; ensure messaging plus retry/recover flows.
