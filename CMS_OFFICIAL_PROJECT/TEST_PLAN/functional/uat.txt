USER ACCEPTANCE TESTING (UAT)
=====================================

Scope
-----
- Scenario-based checks against user stories for admins and standard users.

Approach
--------
- Define acceptance criteria per story (Given/When/Then) and run on a staging build with realistic data.

Coverage
--------
- End-to-end flows (category setup + failure mode entry + fishbone usage), including navigation, messaging, and exports if any.

Cross-platform
--------------
- Run key scenarios on desktop/mobile/tablet and major browsers; verify dark/light theme fidelity.

Sign-off
--------
- Capture evidence (screens, recordings), track defects to closure, and rerun impacted scenarios after fixes.
