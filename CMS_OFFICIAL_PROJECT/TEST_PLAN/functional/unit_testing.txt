===================================
UNIT TESTING (AUTOMATION-FIRST)
===================================

Scope
-----
- Model methods, signals/hooks, helpers, serializers/forms; mock out external calls and DB-heavy dependencies when possible.

Tooling
-------
- pytest + pytest-django; use factories/fixtures for model instances; freezegun for time-based logic.

Setup
-----
- Isolate tests with transactional DB; use in-memory or temp files; seed only what the test needs.

Assertions
----------
- Cover calculations (e.g., RPN), side effects (designation defaults), and ordering meta; assert errors/messages for invalid inputs.

Speed
-----
- Keep tests deterministic and fast; avoid hitting the network; prefer parametrized tests over many near-duplicates.

CI
--
- Run on every push/PR; fail fast; collect coverage for core modules.
