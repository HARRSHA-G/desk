=====================
DEPLOYMENT CHECKS
=====================

Goal
----
- Verify releases are healthy post-deploy.

Steps
-----
- Run DB migrations, collectstatic if needed, restart services/workers, and run smoke tests on key endpoints/UI flows.

Validation
----------
- Check env vars, ALLOWED_HOSTS/CORS, static assets load, and admin login works.

Rollback readiness
------------------
- Keep rollback steps documented and artifacts available; verify data migrations are reversible when possible.

Automation
----------
- Use CI/CD pipelines with post-deploy smoke tests and health checks.
