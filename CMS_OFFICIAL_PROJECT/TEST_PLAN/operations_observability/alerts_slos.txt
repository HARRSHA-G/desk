========================
ALERTS AND SLOs
========================

SLO targets
-----------
- Define targets for availability, latency (p50/p95/p99), and error rate for key flows.

Alerting
--------
- Trigger on SLO burn, elevated 5xx/4xx, auth failures, DB errors, and background job backlogs.

Noise control
-------------
- Tune thresholds and groupings; ensure alerts are actionable with runbooks linked.

Tooling
-------
- Monitoring/alerting stack (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana or vendor); synthetic checks for login and CRUD flows.

Reviews
-------
- Regularly audit alert efficacy and update runbooks after incidents.
