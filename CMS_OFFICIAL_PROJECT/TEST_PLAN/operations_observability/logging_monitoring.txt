LOGGING AND MONITORING
=========================

Goal
----
- Ensure key events and errors are captured, searchable, and alertable.

Logging
-------
- Auth events, CRUD actions, validation failures, and unexpected exceptions; avoid sensitive data in logs.

Monitoring
----------
- Track uptime, latency, error rates, DB health, and background job status.

Tooling
-------
- Structured logs (JSON), central log aggregation, APM where available.

Automation
----------
- CI checks for logger usage in critical paths; synthetic monitors for uptime and key flows.
