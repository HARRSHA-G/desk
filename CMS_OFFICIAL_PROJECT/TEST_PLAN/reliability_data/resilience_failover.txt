========================
RESILIENCE & FAILOVER
========================

Scope
-----
- Behavior during dependency hiccups (DB slowness/outage), partial failures, and restarts.

Checks
------
- Graceful error messaging, retries with backoff where appropriate, and no data corruption on partial writes.

Recovery
--------
- Services restart cleanly; background jobs catch up; user sessions handle reconnect.

Tooling
-------
- Fault injection (DB throttle), chaos testing in lower environments, and log review for error handling.

Automation
----------
- Periodic drills simulating DB/network issues; capture MTTR and user-facing impact.
