===================================
BACKUP / RESTORE & MIGRATIONS
===================================

Migrations
----------
- Run makemigrations/migrate on a copy; verify forward and backward apply; check data transforms where scripts run.

Backups
-------
- Validate backup process (schedule, retention); perform test restores to a staging DB; confirm the app boots on restored data.

Checks
------
- Schema matches models; no data loss on migrations; indexes/constraints present; audit logs remain intact.

Tooling
-------
- Django migrate on snapshot DB; dumpdata/loaddata for smoke; DB-native backup tools for full coverage.

Automation
----------
- Pre-release migration dry-runs; periodic restore drills with success criteria.
