=============================
NAVIGATION & DEEP LINKS
=============================

Scope
-----
- Direct URL access, protected routes, and back/forward behavior.

Checks
------
- Deep-link loads render data (no blank states), invalid IDs show friendly errors/redirects, auth guards route correctly.

State
-----
- Back/forward preserves filters/sort where expected; modals/lazy tabs restore correctly.

Tooling
-------
- Playwright/Cypress for scripted navigation paths; use seeded data for predictable IDs.

Automation
----------
- Include deep-link coverage in regression suites; log any client/router errors.
