===================================
CROSS-PLATFORM PARITY (FUTURE-PROOF)
===================================

Goal
----
- Keep UX/performance consistent if packaged as PWA/native/mobile/desktop.

Checks
------
- Touch/keyboard parity, offline caching strategy, local storage limits, and theming consistency.

Performance
-----------
- Measure startup/load on low-end mobile and mid-tier desktop; watch bundle size and critical path.

Tooling
-------
- Lighthouse/PWA audits; device lab or emulators for mobile form factors.

Automation
----------
- Reuse web E2E scripts against PWA builds where possible; track platform-specific issues separately.
