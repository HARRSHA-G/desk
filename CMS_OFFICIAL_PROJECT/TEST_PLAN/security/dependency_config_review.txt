=================================
DEPENDENCY & CONFIGURATION REVIEW
=================================

Goal
----
- Keep third-party risk low and secrets/config secure.

Checks
------
- Dependency scanning for CVEs (pip-audit, safety), verify pinned versions, and review change logs for breaking/security updates.

Config
------
- Ensure secrets/keys are pulled from env, not committed; check debug flags, CORS/ALLOWED_HOSTS, and logging redaction.

Automation
----------
- Run scanners in CI; periodic manual review of high-severity advisories; verify build artifacts do not leak env vars.
