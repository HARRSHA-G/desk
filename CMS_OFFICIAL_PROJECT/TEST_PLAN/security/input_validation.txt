INPUT VALIDATION & INJECTION SAFETY
=====================================

Goal
----
- Prevent SQLi, XSS, header injection, and payload abuse.

Checks
------
- Server-side validation for all inputs; output encoding in templates; safe file handling if uploads exist.

Tooling
-------
- pytest-django for negative payloads; ZAP/Burp for active scans; linters for template autoescape.

Payloads
--------
- Overlong strings, special characters, HTML/JS injection attempts, and unexpected content types.

Automation
----------
- Include fuzz/negative cases in CI; run periodic DAST on staging; keep test payload corpus versioned.
