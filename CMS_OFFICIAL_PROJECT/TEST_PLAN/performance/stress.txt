STRESS TESTING
=================

What to test
------------
- Push beyond expected load to find breaking points, queue buildup, and failure modes; observe recovery and error messaging.

Recommended tools
-----------------
- k6/Locust with ramp stages; monitor DB connections, cache hit rate, worker queues.

Automation approach
-------------------
- Scheduled in staging; document max sustainable RPS and graceful degradation behaviors.

Critical edge cases
-------------------
- Burst logins and batch CRUD (projects/expenses/payments).
- Download/upload spikes and third-party timeouts.
- Offline retries piling up.
- Large dark/light asset loads.
