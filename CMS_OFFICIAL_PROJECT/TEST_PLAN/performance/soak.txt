=====================
SOAK / ENDURANCE
=====================

What to test
------------
- Sustained normal/peak traffic over hours to catch memory leaks, descriptor exhaustion, and clock drift.

Recommended tools
-----------------
- k6 soak stages, Grafana/Prometheus for long-run metrics, browser performance sampling for UI memory.

Automation approach
-------------------
- Nightly/weekly long-run in staging with production-like data; alert on slow creep in latency or resource usage.

Critical edge cases
-------------------
- Session renewal and token refresh.
- Background tasks (cleanup/cron).
- Offline caching growth.
- Logs rotation.
- Dark/light theme switches over time.
