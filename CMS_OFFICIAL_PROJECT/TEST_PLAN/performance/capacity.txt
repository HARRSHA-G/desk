=====================
CAPACITY TESTING
=====================

What to test
------------
- Scaling limits for concurrent users, data volumes (projects, payments, expenses, attendance records), and storage growth.
- Map when upgrades are needed.

Recommended tools
-----------------
- k6/Locust with dataset scaling.
- DB explain/indices review.
- Browser performance on large lists.

Automation approach
-------------------
- Quarterly capacity runs with snapshots of prod-like data sizes; track headroom per tier.

Critical edge cases
-------------------
- Large paginated lists on mobile.
- Export/download sizes.
- Image-heavy pages in high-DPI.
- Dark/light theme assets.
- Offline cache size growth.
