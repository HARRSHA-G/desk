=======================================
STRESS TESTING (BREAKING POINTS)
=======================================

Goal
----
- Find breaking points beyond expected load and observe failure modes and recovery.

Tooling
-------
- k6/JMeter/locust with stepwise or ramp-to-failure profiles.

Metrics
-------
- Saturation point, error rates, queue depths, DB connection pool exhaustion, and recovery time after load drops.

Observations
------------
- Degradation should be graceful (useful errors, no data loss); services should recover without manual intervention.

Cadence
-------
- Run before major releases or infra changes; document tipping points and mitigation steps.
