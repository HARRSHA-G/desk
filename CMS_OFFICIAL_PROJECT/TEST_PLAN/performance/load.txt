LOAD TESTING
================

What to test
------------
- Steady expected traffic for key APIs/pages.
- Measure p50/p95/p99 latency, throughput, and error rate while keeping resource usage within limits.

Recommended tools
-----------------
- k6 or Locust; browser performance with Playwright traces for UI.
- Capture server metrics (CPU, memory, DB latency).

Automation approach
-------------------
- Run in staging with production-like data; gate releases with SLA thresholds; store trends over time.

Critical edge cases
-------------------
- Auth-heavy endpoints.
- List pagination with large datasets.
- Media/static delivery.
- Dark/light theme assets and high-DPI image loads.
- Mobile networks.
