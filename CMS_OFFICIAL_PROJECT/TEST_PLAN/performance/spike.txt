SPIKE TESTING
================

What to test
------------
- Sudden surges (login storms, bulk imports/exports) and rapid drop-offs; confirm graceful handling and fast recovery.

Recommended tools
-----------------
- k6 spike profile; browser throttling for UI.
- Monitor autoscale signals if available.

Automation approach
-------------------
- Pre-release spike drill; assert no data loss and clear user-facing messaging during overload.

Critical edge cases
-------------------
- DB connection storms and cache cold starts.
- CDN misses and offline-to-online floods.
- Heavy image/card grids on high-DPI devices.
- Theme asset caching.
