========================
CAPACITY TESTING (LIMITS)
========================

Goal
----
- Map system limits for concurrent users, data volume, and request rates to inform scaling plans.

Tooling
-------
- k6/locust/JMeter with gradually increasing load and dataset sizes.

Metrics
-------
- Max sustainable throughput, latency at thresholds, DB index/query behavior with larger tables.

Outcomes
--------
- Document capacity envelopes and needed infra/application optimizations.

Cadence
-------
- Run after schema changes, major features, or infra upgrades.
