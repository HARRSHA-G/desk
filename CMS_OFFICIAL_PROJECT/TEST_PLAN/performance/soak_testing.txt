SOAK / ENDURANCE TESTING
===============================

Goal
----
- Detect memory leaks, resource exhaustion, and slow degradation over long durations.

Tooling
-------
- k6/locust/JMeter with steady expected load for hours.

Metrics
-------
- Memory/CPU trends, file descriptors, DB connections, latency drift, error accumulation.

Checks
------
- Log sizes/rotation, cache growth, scheduled tasks/cron behavior over time.

Cadence
-------
- Run periodically (e.g., weekly) or before large launches; ensure environment monitoring is in place.
