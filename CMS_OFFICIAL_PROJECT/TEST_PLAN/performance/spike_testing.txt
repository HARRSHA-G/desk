============================
SPIKE TESTING (SURGES)
============================

Goal
----
- Validate behavior under sudden bursts of traffic (e.g., mass login, bulk submissions).

Tooling
-------
- k6/locust/JMeter with sharp ramp-up profiles.

Metrics
-------
- Latency/error spikes, queue growth, autoscaling response (if any), and recovery to baseline.

Expectations
------------
- No crashes; informative errors if throttled; fast recovery after spike ends.

Cadence
-------
- Include before marketing pushes or large user onboardings.
