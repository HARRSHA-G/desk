# ** Project Charter: Platform Y **

## **1. The "Why" (Vision & Purpose)**
**Platform Y** is India's answer to global social media giants. Inspired by the utility of "X" (formerly Twitter), Platform Y is designed to be the ultimate public square for 1.4 Billion Indians. 

* **The Problem**: Reliance on foreign-owned microblogging platforms creates risks for data sovereignty and national security.
* **The Mission**: To build a 100% **Made in India** and **Made for India** platform that prioritizes Indian context, security, and scalability.
* **The Vision**: A free-speech-first, high-speed, and secure environment where the Indian voice is sovereign.

## **2. The "What" (Core Features & Unique Logic)**
* **Real-Time Feed**: A massive global and local news feed.
* **Microblogging**: Express thoughts in shorts (Tweets/Posts).
* **Direct Sovereign Access (Government Portal)**: We provide "Super Credentials" to the Government of India (External Affairs/Home Ministry).
* **Anti-India Content Elimination**: Authorized government bodies have the direct power to delete or block posts that are anti-India or portray the nation negatively, both domestically and internationally, without external permission.
* **National Public square**: A platform that belongs to the soil, ensuring India has its own media infrastructure like other global powers (e.g., Truth Social, X).
* **Multimedia Support**: High-definition images, videos, and live streaming.

## **3. The "How" (Scale & Performance)**
* **Billion-User Scale**: Architecture designed to handle 2 Billion+ users from Day 1.
* **Digital Sovereignty**: 100% data residency within Indian borders.
* **High-Speed Execution**: Using the fastest modern frameworks to ensure a "zero-lag" experience.

## **4. Security & Tech Ground Rules**
* **Identity Protection**: Secure ID/Password authentication.
* **Zero-Trust Architecture**: Encrypted data at rest and in transit (AES-256).
* **Indian Hosting**: Distributed across Indian Data Centers (NIC/CtrlS).
